## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript



### What I learned

In this project, I explored and learned how to create a progress bar using the HTML input range element. Leveraging the power of CSS and JavaScript, I successfully implemented a dynamic and visually appealing progress bar that responds to user input. This experience enhanced my understanding of front-end development and provided valuable insights into the capabilities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in crafting interactive user interfaces.

### Continued development
 I plan to deepen my expertise in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I aim to explore advanced concepts, best practices, and emerging technologies to enhance the functionality, user experience, and overall quality of my web applications.
